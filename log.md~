# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Tue 19 May 2020

**Today's Progress**: Trying to get css specificty to apply within a js slideshow. Realised how little I actually know of some of this, so decided to make a more concentrated effort to learn.

**Thoughts:** Chrome Dev tools do some much more than I realised. I've been step though debuging like a fool, when you can  *Break on modification*!  

**Snipit of the day:**

Insert the current date in vim like the title of this:

    :put =strftime('%a %d %b %Y')

### Day 1: Wed 20 May 2020

**Today's Progress**: Installed Vue Cli to try setting up a stand alone vue app for use on external websites. Made a little proof of concept frame that can hold a component and be embedable in a wordpress page!

**Thoughts:** I need to work out the best structure for managaing the base framework that can hold various components inside. Started learning about git submodules which might do the trick.

**Snipit of the day:**

Add a submodule to git:

    git submodule add [URL]
